Final Report: Blockchain Exchange Contracts & Arbitrage Bot Deployment
Objective: Deploy a local blockchain with two exchange contracts and an arbitrage bot.
Status: Successfully deployed and tested on a Hardhat local node.

Key Components
Contracts:

TokenA and TokenB: ERC20 tokens with 18 decimals.

Exchange: Basic AMM-style exchange with liquidity pools.

ArbitrageBot: Detects price differences between exchanges and executes arbitrage.

Contract Creation Details
1. Token Contracts
The ERC20 tokens (TokenA and TokenB) were created using OpenZeppelin’s standardized ERC20 contract.

Code Implementation:

solidity
Copy
// TokenA.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract TokenA is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("TokenA", "TKA") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1_000_000 * 10 ** decimals()); // Mint 1M tokens to deployer
    }
}
Key Features:

Inherits from OpenZeppelin’s audited ERC20 contract for security.

Mints 1,000,000 tokens to the deployer on creation.

Uses 18 decimal places (default for ERC20).

TokenB was created identically with the name TokenB and symbol TKB.

2. Exchange Contract
The Exchange contract allows users to:

Add liquidity to pools.

Swap tokens using a constant product formula (x * y = k).

Calculate token prices based on reserves.

Code Highlights:

solidity
Copy
function swap(address inputToken, uint256 amountIn) external returns (uint256) {
    // Simplified AMM logic with 0.3% fee
    uint256 amountInWithFee = (amountIn * 997) / 1000;
    uint256 amountOut = (amountInWithFee * reserve1) / (reserve0 + amountInWithFee);
    // Update reserves and execute swap
    ...
}
3. Arbitrage Bot Contract
The ArbitrageBot contract:

Monitors price differences between ExchangeA and ExchangeB.

Executes swaps to exploit arbitrage opportunities.

Logic Flow:

solidity
Copy
function executeArbitrage(uint256 amountIn) external {
    uint256 priceA = exchangeA.getPrice();
    uint256 priceB = exchangeB.getPrice();
    if (priceA > priceB) {
        // Buy from ExchangeB, sell to ExchangeA
        ...
    }
}
Fixes & Solutions
(Previous sections on deployment errors, funding, MetaMask integration, and token balances remain unchanged.)

Conclusion
The token contracts (TokenA and TokenB) were successfully created using OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 standard, ensuring compliance with best practices and security. Combined with the exchange and arbitrage bot contracts, this forms a functional decentralized exchange system on a local blockchain.
